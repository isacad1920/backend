# SOFinance Backend

![CI](https://github.com/isacad1920/backend/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

Enterprise-grade Point of Sale & Financial Management backend for multi-branch retail, inventory control, customer management, and accounting operations.

> This repository contains the FastAPI backend. A standardized JSON envelope is enforced; a temporary compatibility shim remains for legacy clients and will be removed in a future major release.

## Key Capabilities

- Authentication & RBAC (roles + granular permissions)
- Multi-branch product & inventory management
- Sales processing with partial / incremental payments
- Customers, credit limits, purchase history
- Double-entry journal & chart of accounts
- Financial & inventory analytics
- System configuration, backups, notifications, audit logging

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| API Framework | FastAPI (async) |
| Language | Python 3.13 |
| ORM / DB Toolkit | Prisma (PostgreSQL) |
| Validation | Pydantic v2 |
| AuthN | JWT / Bearer Tokens |
| Packaging | `pyproject.toml` (PEP 621) |

## Quick Start

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-test.txt
cp .env.example .env  # adjust values
python run.py  # starts uvicorn
```

### Environment Variables (Selected)

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| DATABASE_URL | PostgreSQL connection string |
| ENABLE_AUDIT_LOGGING | Toggle persistent audit trail |
| ENABLE_KEY_MIRRORING | Legacy response key mirroring (set false when clients updated) |
| RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE / RATE_LIMIT_BURST | Rate limiting thresholds |

See `app/core/config.py` for the authoritative list.

## Running Tests

```bash
pytest -q
```

Key test areas include response envelope integrity, financial integrity decorators, and journal balance validation.

## Migrations

Schema changes are managed via Prisma:
```bash
prisma migrate dev --name <change>
prisma generate
```

## Project Layout

```
app/
	core/            # config, security, error/response systems
	middlewares/     # auth, rate limit, security headers, normalization
	modules/         # domain modules (users, products, sales, journal, ...)
	utils/           # helpers (pdf, decimals, etc.)
generated/         # Prisma generated client
prisma/            # schema.prisma & migrations
tests/             # pytest suite
scripts/           # (retained) operational / seeding utilities
```

## Response Contract

Every successful call: `{ "success": true, "message": str, "data": <payload>, "error": null, "meta": {...}, "timestamp": ISO8601 }`

Failures: `{ "success": false, "error": {"code": CODE, "message": str, "details": {} }, "meta": {...}, "timestamp": ... }`

The transitional `ResponseNormalizationMiddleware` wraps legacy free-form JSON and will be deprecated after client migration.

## Error Handling

Custom exceptions (`APIError` and subclasses) are converted by a normalization middleware to structured envelopes. Unhandled exceptions become `INTERNAL_ERROR` with sanitized details. Validation errors (Pydantic / FastAPI) produce `VALIDATION_ERROR`.

## Financial Integrity

Critical financial and sales endpoints use integrity decorators to recompute transactional totals and enforce journal balance. All monetary values are handled internally as `Decimal` and serialized as strings quantized to 2 decimal places.

## Security

- JWT tokens with refresh capability
- Role + permission enforcement via dependency guards
- Rate limiting & security headers middleware
- Optional audit logging for key domain actions

## Development Workflow

1. Create / update schema in `prisma/schema.prisma`
2. Run migrations (`prisma migrate dev`)
3. Implement service + routes; return standardized responses
4. Add/extend tests in `tests/`
5. Run `pytest` locally; ensure envelope + integrity tests pass

## Deprecation Notes

- Response key mirroring is slated for removal; clients should rely exclusively on the `data` object.
- Public temporary test endpoints (prefixed with `_test`) are excluded from production documentation.

## License / Compliance

Internal project (proprietary). Ensure GDPR / data retention policies applied to audit & backups per deployment context.

## üîÑ Transitional Compatibility Layer

To complete the migration to standardized API envelopes without breaking a large pre-existing test suite, the backend currently includes a `ResponseNormalizationMiddleware` (see `app/main.py`). This shim:

1. Wraps raw dict/list/primitive JSON responses into `{ success, message, data, meta, timestamp }`.
2. Mirrors a curated set of frequently asserted keys (e.g. `items`, `total`, `revenue`, `price`, `stockQuantity`, `gross_profit`) from `data` to top-level for legacy tests.
3. Passes through specific inventory & financial analytics endpoints unwrapped when historical tests relied on raw lists/dicts (e.g. stock levels, comprehensive inventory, income statement).
4. Skips non-JSON or documentation paths to avoid corrupting streamed or static responses.
5. Injects top-level `id` for creation responses when tests asserted it outside the `data` object.

### Why it Exists
Legacy tests (and some early UI code) performed assertions like `assert 'revenue' in data` instead of navigating `data['revenue']`. The middleware lets us standardize new endpoints immediately while phasing in test updates gradually.

### Deprecation Roadmap
| Phase | Action |
|-------|--------|
| 1 | Add debug log when mirroring occurs (future) |
| 2 | Remove non-essential mirrored keys after test updates |
| 3 | Require explicit opt-out for raw pass-through endpoints |
| 4 | Remove middleware entirely once all clients consume canonical envelope |

### Guidance for New Code
Always return using `success_response()` / `paginated_response()`. Avoid depending on key mirroring; treat it as a read-only backward compatibility layer.

If you remove a mirrored key, update tests to assert via `data[...]` first. Keep the `common_keys` set in a steady or shrinking state‚Äîno unbounded growth.

### Financial Analytics
### Inventory Enhancements (Low Stock Batch & Dead Stock Scan)

New advanced inventory optimization endpoints and frontend integrations:

```
GET    /api/v1/inventory/low-stock/batch      - Paginated low stock alerts
				Query params:
					page (int, default 1)
					page_size (int, default 25, max 200)
					threshold (int, optional override of system default)
				Response JSON:
					{
						items: LowStockAlert[],
						page, page_size,
						total_items,
						page_count,
						threshold: <override or null>,
						default_threshold: <system default>
					}

GET    /api/v1/inventory/low-stock-alerts     - Full low stock alert list (uses configured default threshold)
GET    /api/v1/inventory/low-stock            - Legacy alias of low-stock-alerts

POST   /api/v1/inventory/dead-stock/scan      - Trigger asynchronous dead stock analysis
				Query params:
					days_threshold (int, optional override; defaults to configured dead stock days)
				Returns 202 Accepted style payload indicating scan status

GET    /api/v1/inventory/dead-stock/latest    - Latest cached dead stock scan results & status
				Response JSON:
					{
						items: DeadStockAnalysis[],
						last_scan: ISO timestamp | null,
						scanning: boolean,
						params: { days_threshold }
					}
```

#### Threshold Configuration

Configuration keys in `app/core/config.py` (surface via `settings`):

- `default_low_stock_threshold` ‚Äì Applied when no explicit threshold query param supplied.
- `dead_stock_days_threshold` ‚Äì Days without sales to classify an item as dead stock for the scan.

#### Frontend Integrations

Implemented in the Next.js frontend (see `frontend/src/components/inventory/`):

- `LowStockBatchPanel` ‚Äì Server-side pagination + threshold override, auto-refresh toggle, empty-state toast when custom threshold yields no results.
- `DeadStockScanPanel` ‚Äì Trigger background scan, live polling of `/dead-stock/latest`, skeleton loading states.
	- Category filter & server-side search: The panel now forwards `search` (name/SKU) and `category_id` query params to the batch endpoint to offload filtering to the backend (reduces client memory & keeps pagination accurate). Selection persistence, aggregate suggested order quantity, CSV export, and auto-refresh pause while selecting are supported.

Auto-refresh intervals supported: 15s, 30s, 60s (default), 120s. Toast feedback informs users when a chosen high threshold returns zero results, encouraging threshold adjustment.

#### Usage Notes

- Prefer the batched endpoint for UI lists to avoid transmitting large alert arrays.
- Use `low-stock-alerts` only for small admin dashboards or export jobs.
- Dead stock scan is idempotent while a scan is in progress; repeated trigger calls return a `scanning: true` status without spawning duplicate work.
- The in-memory scan cache is ephemeral; consider persisting results if long-term historical tracking is desired (future enhancement).

### Backup & Restore System

The platform includes a comprehensive backup / restore workflow exposed via system endpoints and a React management panel (`BackupManagerPanel`).

#### Key Endpoints (System)

```
POST   /api/v1/system/backup/create                 - Request a new backup (async creation)
GET    /api/v1/system/backups                       - List backups (metadata, size, status)
GET    /api/v1/system/backups/{id}/download         - Download specific backup JSON
POST   /api/v1/system/backups/{id}/restore          - Dry-run (default) or apply restore (apply=true, confirm token)
POST   /api/v1/system/backups/{id}/restore/async    - Start background restore job (requires confirm token)
GET    /api/v1/system/backups/restore/jobs/{jobId}  - Poll async restore job status
POST   /api/v1/system/restore/confirm-token         - Issue short-lived confirmation token for destructive restore
GET    /api/v1/system/backups/{id}/verify           - Checksum verification (integrity)
GET    /api/v1/system/backups/stream                - Streaming export (large datasets)
```

#### Restore Modes

| Mode | Trigger | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Dry Run | `POST /backups/{id}/restore` (default apply=false) | Parses backup & reports row counts per table (no mutation). |
| Apply (Immediate) | `POST /backups/{id}/restore?apply=true&confirm_token=...` | Truncates tables in dependency-safe order then inserts rows. Requires confirmation token. |
| Async Apply | `POST /backups/{id}/restore/async?confirm_token=...` | Queues background job; progress polled via jobs endpoint. |

Confirmation tokens are single-use, short-lived, and mandatory for destructive apply/async restores‚Äîmitigates accidental data loss.

#### Integrity & Safety

* Dry-run first: surfaces missing tables or schema drift early.
* Checksum verification compares stored checksum to computed digest for tamper detection.
* Async jobs enforce concurrency limits (configurable) and provide progress percentages.
* Rate limiting / token gating protects critical operations from misuse.

#### Frontend `BackupManagerPanel` Features

* List backups with size, status, created timestamp.
* Create new backup (optimistic row insert + refresh).
* Dry-run, immediate apply, or async restore actions (each gated by confirmation when destructive).
* Progress polling with live status card for async jobs.
* Streaming export for large backup downloads without loading entire file into memory at once.
* Checksum verification with inline result (OK / mismatch).

#### Suggested Operational Workflow
1. Create backup before major schema or bulk data changes.
2. Use dry-run on target backup to validate table counts.
3. (Optional) Verify checksum for critical compliance scenarios.
4. Obtain confirmation token & perform async restore in off-peak hours.
5. Monitor restore job until completion; investigate failures with returned error log.

#### Future Enhancements (Roadmap)
* Incremental (diff-based) backups
* Encryption at rest for backup artifacts
* Scheduled automatic backups (cron-driven)
* UI surfacing historical restore attempts & audit linkage
* Multi-storage backend (S3, GCS) abstraction

## üõ†Ô∏è Frontend Development & Testing

To run the frontend locally:

```
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Handling npm EACCES Cache Errors
If you encounter an error like `EACCES: permission denied, open ... /.npm/_cacache/...` your global npm cache has root-owned files. Fix ownership:

```
sudo chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) ~/.npm
```

If you cannot use sudo (CI or restricted env) set a project-local cache:

```
mkdir -p .npm-cache
npm set cache $(pwd)/.npm-cache --location=project
npm install
```

### Running Tests
Once dependencies install successfully:
```
npm run test
```
If tests were previously excluded from TypeScript build, ensure `tsconfig.json` includes the test directory or keep them isolated if you want faster prod builds.

### Optional: Use pnpm or yarn
You can also bootstrap with another package manager which maintains its own store and often avoids cache ownership issues:
```
corepack enable
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

### Real-time Notifications (WebSocket)

The backend exposes a WebSocket endpoint for notifications:

- URL: `/api/v1/notifications/ws?token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>`
- The frontend Topbar auto-connects when logged in and refreshes unread counts on incoming events.
